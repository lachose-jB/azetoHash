# Complex Password Hashing Script

## Description

This Python script implements a complex password hashing algorithm that combines several techniques to enhance security. The key steps include:

1. **Elliptic Curve Transformation**: Uses the SECP256k1 elliptic curve to sign the data for added cryptographic strength.
2. **Temporal Transformation**: Adds time-based transformations to introduce variability and make brute-force attacks more difficult.
3. **Entropy Compression**: Utilizes BLAKE2b to condense and maximize the density of the final hash.

## Features

- **Secure Hashing**: The combination of elliptic curve cryptography, time-based transformations, and entropy compression results in highly secure password hashes.
- **Unique Salt Generation**: Each user gets a unique salt to further secure the hashing process.
- **Flexible Parameters**: The number of rounds and dimensions can be customized for different security levels.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install ecdsa
    ```

## Usage

The script can be run directly by modifying the `password` and `user_id` variables in the code. Example usage:

```python
password = "MotDePasseComplexe"
user_id = "utilisateur456"
user_salt = generate_user_salt()
hashed_password = complex_hash_function(password, user_id, user_salt)
print(f"Hashed Password: {hashed_password}")
print(f"User Salt: {user_salt}")
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `ecdsa` library for elliptic curve operations

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install ecdsa
```

## How to install and integrate into your projects:

### 1. Installation with `pip` for Python projects:

Install the dependencies and integrate this solution into your web or application project.

```bash
pip install ecdsa
```

### 2. Installation with `npm` for web (Node.js) projects:

To integrate into Node.js projects or web applications, you can use `npm` to add the necessary dependencies:

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage:

Once installed, simply run the script by providing a password and a user ID. The system will generate a unique, secure hash for each user.

### Example code:

```python
password = "MotDePasseComplexe"
user_id = "utilisateur456"
user_salt = generate_user_salt()
hashed_password = complex_hash_function(password, user_id, user_salt)
print(f"Hashed Password: {hashed_password}")
```
